### Building Production AI Systems for Energy & Industrial Operations

Founding Engineer scaling AI from prototype to production. I architect agentic RAG systems, predictive ML pipelines, and compliance automation that run in enterprise environments.

```
Focus Areas:
├── Agentic RAG & Multi-Agent Orchestration
├── Predictive Maintenance & Anomaly Detection
├── Regulatory Compliance Automation (NERC CIP)
└── Cloud-Native ML (Azure AI Foundry, GCP Vertex AI)
```
